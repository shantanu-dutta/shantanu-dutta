# ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on
I have over seven years of experience in full-stack development, beginning my career at TCS in 2017, where I spent 4.5 years working as a Full Stack Developer. My role at TCS involved creating complex, scalable web applications using Angular and .NET. During this time, I worked on a range of client-driven projects that required a high level of technical expertise and adaptability to new tools and methods. My responsibilities included building dynamic user interfaces, optimizing backend services, and collaborating across teams to deliver solutions that met client needs.

In 2021, I joined Cognizant, where Iâ€™ve been part of a major project using Java Spring Boot and Angular. Here, I focus on designing secure and efficient APIs and building interactive front-end components for robust enterprise applications. Outside of work, I stay updated with modern front-end frameworks by working on React-based projects in my free time. These personal projects allow me to explore new features and maintain hands-on experience with emerging tools, helping me to keep my skills sharp and ready for the evolving demands of the tech industry.

# ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning
To expand my knowledge, I am delving into advanced microservices architecture, particularly focusing on optimizing service-to-service communication and resilience patterns. This has allowed me to explore various strategies, such as the use of API gateways and service discovery, which are essential for building large, distributed applications. Iâ€™m also learning Kubernetes and Docker for efficient containerization and orchestration.

Moreover, Iâ€™m exploring cloud-native tools and best practices for deploying applications on platforms like AWS and Google Cloud. With cloud technology playing a huge role in modern development, I want to stay updated on ways to improve scalability, performance, and security in cloud environments.

# ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on
I'm open to collaborating on projects that involve complex full-stack systems, especially those with a focus on performance, security, and scalability. If you are working on a product with a strong backend requirement or a rich UI, I would love to contribute to both the design and development of the architecture and user experience. I believe that collaborative coding can bring about innovative solutions.

I am also interested in projects that contribute to open-source communities. Working together on these projects helps us create tools that benefit developers worldwide. Iâ€™d be thrilled to join a team that values innovation and knowledge sharing.

# ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with
I am actively looking for guidance on scaling microservices efficiently, particularly in handling inter-service communication and optimizing deployment pipelines. If you have experience in this area, Iâ€™d love to discuss best practices and frameworks that simplify this process. I believe that there is a lot to learn from seasoned architects in distributed system design.

Iâ€™m also interested in learning more about observability in production systems, especially with tools that allow for real-time monitoring and diagnostics. Any recommendations or tips on implementing a solid observability stack would be incredibly helpful as I work towards strengthening my DevOps skills.

# âš¡ Fun fact
A fun fact about my daily routine is that I start each morning with a quick coding challenge to keep my problem-solving skills sharp. Itâ€™s my favorite way to kick-start the day and get into a focused mindset! Whether itâ€™s a small algorithm puzzle or exploring a new framework feature, this routine fuels my curiosity and helps me stay in touch with the fundamentals.

In the evenings, I often spend time experimenting with new features in JavaScript or React. Itâ€™s a relaxing way for me to unwind while also expanding my skillsetâ€”learning something new each day keeps me motivated!

Outside of work, Iâ€™m an avid reader and a technology enthusiast. I enjoy exploring new programming paradigms and emerging trends, whether it's artificial intelligence, blockchain, or the latest in cloud computing. Learning something new each day keeps my curiosity alive and drives my passion for technology.
